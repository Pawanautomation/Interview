**Here are some automation task ideas for a Playwright and TypeScript interview, each designed to be completed within 30 minutes:**

### Basic Tasks:
1. **Navigating and Interacting:**
   * Navigate to a specific website (e.g., Amazon, Google, or a popular e-commerce site).
   * Search for a product (e.g., "iPhone 15").
   * Click on the first product result.
   * Add the product to the cart.
   * Verify the product is added to the cart.
2. **Form Filling and Submission:**
   * Navigate to a registration form (e.g., a test form on a website).
   * Fill out the form with valid data.
   * Submit the form.
   * Verify a success message or confirmation page.
3. **Handling Alerts and Popups:**
   * Navigate to a website that triggers alerts or popups (e.g., a cookie consent banner).
   * Handle the alert or popup (e.g., accept, dismiss, or interact with it).
4. **File Uploading:**
   * Navigate to a file upload form.
   * Select a local file and upload it.
   * Verify the file is uploaded successfully.

### Intermediate Tasks:
1. **Testing Dynamic Content:**
   * Navigate to a website with dynamic content (e.g., news articles, social media feeds).
   * Verify that elements load correctly and are interactive.
   * Assert on specific content (e.g., headlines, images, links).
2. **Handling Frames and Iframes:**
   * Navigate to a website with embedded iframes (e.g., YouTube videos, Google Maps).
   * Switch to the iframe and interact with elements within it (e.g., play a video, search for a location).
3. **Testing Authentication Flows:**
   * Navigate to a website with login functionality.
   * Enter valid credentials and log in.
   * Verify successful login by checking user-specific content.
   * Log out and verify successful logout.
4. **Testing API Requests:**
   * Use Playwright's API request capabilities to send HTTP requests.
   * Test API endpoints for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   * Validate response status codes, headers, and body content.

### Advanced Tasks:
1. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   * Write tests that run on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
   * Verify consistent behavior across different browsers and devices.
2. **Visual Regression Testing:**
   * Compare screenshots of web pages to detect visual changes.
   * Identify and report visual regressions.
3. **Performance Testing:**
   * Measure page load times and other performance metrics.
   * Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
4. **End-to-End Testing:**
   * Simulate complex user flows involving multiple pages and interactions.
   * Test scenarios like shopping cart checkout, form submissions, and user account management.

**Remember to use the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern to structure your tests:**

1. **Arrange:** Set up the test environment, including navigating to the correct URL and identifying necessary elements.
2. **Act:** Perform the actions you want to test, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, or submitting requests.
3. **Assert:** Verify the expected outcomes, such as page content, error messages, or successful form submissions.
